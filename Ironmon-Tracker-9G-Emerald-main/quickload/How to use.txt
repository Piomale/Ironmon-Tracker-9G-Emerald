 INTRODUCTION TO NEW RUNS
--------------------------
The "New Runs" feature is a feature of the Ironmon Tracker that allows you to easily load a new game ROM to play, without having to go through any menus or do it manually.
This feature was previously known as "Quickload", but was renamed for clarity.

To use the New Runs feature of the Tracker, you'll need to provide it with all of the required files it needs.
The Tracker will use these files to load up a new game ROM each time you activate New Run by pressing the button combination (A + B + START by default).

---------------------------
           SETUP
---------------------------
[quickload] - This refers to the "quickload" folder found inside your main Tracker folder.

There are two different ways to use New Runs:
1) From a set of premade ROMs that were created beforehand
2) By automatically generating a new randomized ROM each time

TO USE OPTION 1: Premade ROMs
-----------------------------
You will need to provide the Tracker with all of the game ROM files that you made.
- If you haven't already, first create a batch of randomized ROMs using the Randomizer program.
- Ensure that the ROMs are numbered in sequential order, such as FireRed1.gba, FireRed2.gba, etc
- Place all of the ROMs into this [quickload] folder
- Finally, load up the first ROM (smallest number) from among them into your emulator

EXAMPLE SETUP (OPTION 1)
------------------------
The [quickload] folder contains the following files:
- Emerald1.gba
- Emerald2.gba
- Emerald3.gba
- Emerald4.gba
- etc.

TO USE OPTION 2: Generate a ROM
-------------------------------
You will need to provide the Tracker with three files in order for it to create a randomized ROM for you. Place each file in this [quickload] folder.

- File 1: Copy & paste the JAR file (typically named "PokeRandoZX.jar") from the Randomizer folder into the [quickload] folder
- File 2: Copy & paste the GBA ROM file you want to use for creating a randomized game, and place it into the [quickload] folder
  - Do NOT use an already randomized game ROM
- File 3: Copy & paste an RNQS settings file into the [quickload] folder
  - This file is the Randomizer settings/options that determine how you want your game to be randomized
  - You can either use one of the preloaded Ironmon settings files found in folder: /ironmon_tracker/RandomizerSettings
  - Or you can make your own settings file using the Randomizer program, loading the settings you want, then clicking Save Settings

EXAMPLE SETUP (OPTION 2)
------------------------
The [quickload] folder contains the following files:
- PokeRandoZX.jar
- Pokemon Emerald (intro skip).gba
- RSE Kaizo.rnqs

---------------------------
       FINISH SETUP
---------------------------
Once you've placed the required files into the [quickload] folder, the last step is to let the Tracker know which of these two options you want to use.
To do so, simply load up the Tracker, then go to the New Runs setup page under Tracker settings.
Finally, select which of the two options you intend to use:
  (1) Premade ROMs
  (2) Generate a ROM
